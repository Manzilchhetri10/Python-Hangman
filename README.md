# Hangman Game (Python, TDD)

## 🎮 Description
This is a **Hangman game** implemented in Python using **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**.  
The game has two levels:
- **Basic**: A single word is chosen randomly.
- **Intermediate**: A phrase is chosen randomly.

The player has:
- **6 lives** by default  
- **15 seconds** to guess each letter  

If the player fails to provide input within the time limit, **a life is deducted**.  

The game ends when the player:
- ✅ Wins (all letters revealed)  
- ❌ Loses (lives reach 0)  
- 🚪 Quits manually
